## 📨 Email Header Forensics

Source File: sample-email.txt

- Sender IP: 209.85.166.52  
- SPF: PASS  
- DKIM: PASS  
- DMARC: PASS  
- Claimed Sender: sender@gmail.com

💡 Interpretation:  
This email passed key authentication checks, but investigating relay IP and header hops still helps confirm sender identity — especially in spoofing or targeted fraud.

---

## 📸 Web Screenshot Capture

Target: https://cyberpulse.in  
📁 File: cyberpulse-screenshot-20250616-214129.png

💡 Interpretation:  
Capturing real-time screenshots of target websites allows analysts to preserve volatile content before it's removed. This is standard practice in cybercrime investigations and media fact-checking teams.

---

## 🔗 Redirect Chain Analysis

**Input URL:** https://bit.ly/3I6ZzrY

**Result:**  
✅ No redirects. The URL leads directly to its destination.

💡 **Interpretation:**  
Although this specific shortened URL leads directly to a final site, many phishing or scam URLs pass through multiple redirect layers to mask their destination. Always trace these chains to uncover the true endpoint.

---

## 🧠 Analyst Interpretation

(Write your 2–3 line expert interpretation here.)

The target domain is missing multiple critical HTTP security headers. This suggests poor web server hardening and could expose users to risks like clickjacking, MIME-type attacks, or data leakage. Immediate improvements in header configuration are recommended.

## 📨 Email Leak Awareness Scan

**Website:** https://cyberpulse.in  
**Emails Found:** [List them here or write “None found”]  
**Screenshot:** screenshots/email-check-cyberpulse.png

### 🔍 Analyst Note:
This phase simulates how OSINT agents gather surface-level emails from websites and assess them for potential breach signals or sensitive roles (admin, support). Useful in early attack surface mapping.

## 🖼️ Phase 15.5 - Reverse Image Search UI Enhancement

**Image Searched:** Screenshot_213455.png  
**Search Engine Used:** CLIP + FAISS (Offline)  
**Screenshot Saved:** screenshots/reverse-search-ui-20250621.png

### 🔍 Analyst Note:
This enhancement allows analysts to view matched images directly on the interface, streamlining the process of verifying visual similarities. The UI now displays the matched image (e.g., `shoe.png`) alongside its 87.33% similarity score, preserving the offline capability and enhancing usability for forensic analysis.

## 🗃️ Phase 18: Session Logging & Export

### Overview:
This phase enables session-wide logging and export of analyst actions for audit and reporting purposes.

- Tracks tool usage (tool name, input, result)
- Timestamps every action
- UI allows export in JSON and CSV formats
- Real-time preview of session log

### Example Entry:
```json
{
  "tool": "Metadata",
  "input": "Soumya Resume.docx",
  "result": {
    "score": "Low",
    "keys": ["author", "created"]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-25T09:57:48Z"
}


## 🔐 Phase 19: User Authentication System
Overview:
This phase introduces secure analyst authentication into the Cygnal platform. All tools are now protected behind a login wall to ensure session integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

✅ Key Features:
Registration with unique email and username enforcement

Password strength validation (min 8 chars, upper, lower, number, symbol)

Real-time email format validation

Prevention of duplicate usernames or email addresses

Password visibility toggle (Show/Hide) for better UX

Zustand-based frontend session store with persistent login

All tools and dashboard hidden until user logs in

🧠 Analyst Note:
Authentication is critical for forensic platforms. It ensures only authorized analysts access sensitive features, enabling better audit trails, accountability, and compliance with real-world cyber investigation workflows.


## 🔐 Phase 20: Authentication System + Access Control

Cygnal now includes a full user-based authentication system to restrict tool usage and protect sensitive analysis features.

### Key Features:
- User registration + login (email, username, password)
- JWT token authentication (expires after 3 days)
- Route-level access control (tools gated behind login)
- Zustand state store manages session and auto-logout

🧪 Tested via devtools:
- Token stored in localStorage (`cygnal_token`)
- Route blocks tools if token is missing
- Token removal logs user out on refresh

## 🔐 Phase 21: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This phase introduces role-based gating of tools to restrict access based on a user’s assigned role. All tools are now accessible only to users with the analyst or admin role.
Key Features:
Each registered user is assigned the analyst role by default
Roles are stored in the database and included in the JWT token
Tools such as Header Scanner, WHOIS, Screenshot Tool, Metadata Recon, and Reverse Image Search now check the user’s role before allowing access
Unauthorized users (e.g. unauthenticated or viewer roles) are shown a message and blocked from using the tools
Role enforcement is done at the frontend using Zustand and on the backend via token claims
Analyst Note:
Role-based control is a foundational security layer for forensic applications. It prepares Cygnal for multi-user environments with tiered permissions (e.g., viewer-only access or admin-only actions).
