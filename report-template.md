## 📸 Web Screenshot Capture

Target: https://cyberpulse.in
📁 File: cyberpulse-screenshot-20250616-214129.png

💡 Interpretation:
Capturing real-time screenshots of target websites allows analysts to preserve volatile content before it's removed. This is standard practice in cybercrime investigations and media fact-checking teams.

## 🔗 Redirect Chain Analysis

**Input URL:** https://bit.ly/3I6ZzrY

**Result:**
✅ No redirects. The URL leads directly to its destination.

💡 **Interpretation:**
Although this specific shortened URL leads directly to a final site, many phishing or scam URLs pass through multiple redirect layers to mask their destination. Always trace these chains to uncover the true endpoint.

## 🧠 Analyst Interpretation

(Write your 2–3 line expert interpretation here.)

The target domain is missing multiple critical HTTP security headers. This suggests poor web server hardening and could expose users to risks like clickjacking, MIME-type attacks, or data leakage. Immediate improvements in header configuration are recommended.
