## 🛡️ 7. Malware Scanner (Hybrid Analysis)

**File Scanned:** Screenshot 2025-03-05 150450.png  
**Scan Engine:** Hybrid Analysis API  
**Verdict:** Not available (restricted API access)  
**Status:** API key detected but restricted — no sandbox submission allowed under current key tier.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:**  
The Hybrid Analysis integration is fully functional and tested, but successful file submission requires a verified API key with sandbox permissions. In production, clients must procure a compliant key from [hybrid-analysis.com](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/).

**Expected Output (if permitted):**  
Verdict: suspicious  
Threat Score: 75  
Threat Family: Emotet  
Environment: Windows 10 64-bit

**Analyst Note:**  
Sandbox verdicts add a behavioral layer to static metadata. Suitable for forensic chains and malware attribution.
