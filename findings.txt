- Performs fast static scan using HTML content
- Falls back to JavaScript-rendered scan if no emails found
- Crawls up to 10 internal links from the same domain (e.g. /contact, /about)
UX:
- Real-time status messaging (e.g. fallback triggered, JS scan success/fail)
- Robust error handling and full session logging
Status: ✅ Completed

[Phase 23] – Intelligence Audit Logging & SIEM Integration
Logging:
- Tracks each tool invocation with timestamp, user, IP, input, and output
- Stored in `audit_logs/audit_log.json` as newline-delimited JSON entries
- Automatically forwarded to:
  - Syslog (UDP 514) — supports external SIEM ingestion
  - AWS CloudWatch Logs — centralized cloud-based log monitoring
Tamper Prevention:
- Append-only log format ensures integrity
- CLI and admin-viewer access with role enforcement
Status: ✅ Completed


[Phase 24] – Persistent Audit Storage (SQLite DB Logging)
Database:
- All tool usage logs mirrored in `lookup_logs.db` under `lookups` table
- Stores: timestamp, user, IP, tool, input, result (JSON)
- Fully automated from `audit_logger.py`, no extra config needed
Analysis:
- Logs inspectable using `check_logs.py` utility
- Ready for future integration into dashboards or admin viewer
Status: ✅ Completed


END OF FINDINGS LOG
All phases above were successfully implemented and tested under simulated investigation scenarios.

[Phase 26] – Visual Dashboard (Role-Based Tool Usage Analytics)
Dashboard:
Admin-only dashboard now accessible at /dashboard
Displays real-time analytics via Chart.js:
📊 Tool Usage Frequency (bar chart)
📈 Tool Usage Timeline (per-tool line chart)
📆 Last 5 Days Activity (rolling line graph with dynamic updates)
Color-coded by tool, with interactive legends and scroll animations
Fully integrated into frontend via dynamic SSR-safe import
Access Control:
Dashboard route is protected via JWT role-check (admin only)
Non-admins are redirected silently back to /
Status: ✅ Completed
