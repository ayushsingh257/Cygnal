[Phase 28] – IP Reputation Tracker (AbuseIPDB/IPinfo)  
Tool: IPReputationTool  
Target: 8.8.8.8, 45.227.254.19, 185.100.87.202  
Abuse Scores:  

Google DNS (8.8.8.8): 0/100, 50 reports (no abuse confidence)  
xwinnet.biz (45.227.254.19): 1,867 reports, abuse confidence 0%  
flokinet.is (185.100.87.202): 15,937 reports, abuse confidence 0%  

Insight: AbuseIPDB API integration confirmed. Query returns valid ISP, usage type, country, and abuse metadata. However, abuseConfidenceScore returned as 0 even on high-report IPs — likely due to AbuseIPDB omitting the field in free-tier API responses.  
Use Case: Detect potential malicious infrastructure (e.g. bulletproof hosts, proxies, known spammers).  
Logging:  

Admin Audit Trail: ✅ Logged under “IP Reputation”  
Visual Dashboard: ✅ Timeline and frequency graph integrated  
Scan History: ✅ Captured with timestamp and input  

Design Note: Tool integrates with AbuseIPDB API using analyst API key stored in .env. Results are audit-logged and visualized.

Integration: VirusTotal Public API (Passive DNS endpoint)  
Logging:  
- Visual Dashboard Timeline: ✅  
- Admin Audit Trail: ✅  
- Session History: ✅  
Use Case: Infrastructure correlation, pivot-based reconnaissance, historic visibility into domain/IP relationships  
Design Note: Passive DNS tool queries VT’s DNS resolution archive and parses temporal relationships between domains and resolved IPs. Especially useful for linking suspicious IPs from reputation scans to previously unknown or rotating domains.  
Status: ✅ Completed
